Android client for the [remote location tracking](https://www.softbank.jp/mobile/service/mimamorigps/) in SoftBank Mobile's
[Mimamori Keitai 4](https://www.softbank.jp/mobile/products/keitai/mimamori-keitai4/).

It provides the same basic features as [みまもりGPSアプリ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.softbank.mb.rcpg),
which is unfortunately carrier-restricted and thus cannot be used by a parent not on
SoftBank Mobile.

Multi-SIM phones are supported.

> ⚠️ Although the app uses [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), this is an Android-only project ﹣iOS is not supported.
